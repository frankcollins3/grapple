sleep_cycle_app: sleep bouts of which a ${winner} is made from negotiation of ${chokehold} 

${winner} wins by: ${chokehold}       

This app is a jab at the timing and positioning factor of polyphasic sleep / cycling sleep.

// UI changes from white to black through the day as one is winning their scheduled sleep naps. 
// probably in Next.js but would be interested if one could link [ c / gcc ] up and pick the ${chokehold} data from an array in a c program v.s. js 

// realizing this has to be Full Stack because there needs to be a table for "strategies" onto which a user stores tips/techniques/tactics

// main_cont boxerRope border ||  gi/karate-uniform with the main container just above the belt which will color-toggle based on daily performance

// capitalize on how easy a well themed minimalistic white 
// [white-gi.png, redglove.png, whitebelt.png, bluebelt.png, blackbelt.png etc.., 

// bookmarking the cheesy link between:     A knockout during a fight |      "Knocking-out" for bed.    (theming must be utilized
Bouts can go three ways:        Core sleep is met -> then for 20 minute naps: { W: user wins with ${ TakeDown | Chokehold } { Draw: user misses nap but stays awake } { L: user knocks out for bed } 

possible Slogan for the app: TAKEDOWN TIRED!
